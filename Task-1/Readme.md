# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
This EDA aims to uncover patterns and insights from customer, product, and transaction datasets. Using data inspection, cleaning, merging, and visualization techniques, the analysis identifies key trends and business opportunities.

## Data Inspection and Cleaning
- Reviewed missing values, data types, and duplicates.
- Ensured datasets were free of duplicates and handled missing critical values.

## Merging Datasets
- Unified the datasets by merging customer, product, and transaction information into one comprehensive view for analysis.

## EDA Techniques
- **Visualizations:** Explored trends, distributions, and relationships using bar plots, heatmaps, and pie charts.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Assessed numeric relationships, such as the impact of quant
