Task 2: Lookalike Model

This project implements a Lookalike Model that identifies and recommends the top 3 most similar customers based on their profile and transaction history. The recommendations are generated using a combination of customer demographics, transaction behavior, and product category preferences.

Features:

1. Feature Engineering:
   - Customer profiles (Region) with one-hot encoding.
   - Transaction behavior (total spend, average spend, transaction count, items purchased).
   - Product category preferences (percentage spend per category).

2. Similarity Calculation:
   - Features are standardized using StandardScaler.
   - Pairwise cosine similarity is calculated to identify similar customers.

3. Output:
   - A CSV file with top 3 similar customers for the first 20 customers.
   - Each record includes the customer_id and a list of recommendations with similarity scores.
